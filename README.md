**How AI Accelerated Development**
AI tools were instrumental in completing this project within the tight 4-hour timeframe:

ChatGPT helped generate the initial project structure and provided solutions for complex state management scenarios

GitHub Copilot significantly reduced typing time and suggested optimal implementations

Cursor AI assisted with debugging and provided alternative approaches to problems

AI tools collectively saved approximately 60% of development time that would have been spent on research and trial-and-error

The most valuable AI contribution was automatically generating the form validation logic and campaign submission handler, which would have taken hours to implement manually.
